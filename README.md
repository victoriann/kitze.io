# kitze.io

🛠 Just my overengineered personal website.
Generated with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [custom-react-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-react-scripts).

### 📚 Libraries
* React
* styled-components
* font-awesome
* animate.css
* jQuery

### 🤔 But ... why?
Why doesn't it consist of three simple ```index.html```, ```app.css```, and ```main.js``` files?

Well, it did. But I wanted to experiment with [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) for a while, and this was a good excuse for it.

Also, I have some plans for making it better and more interactive in the future, and that would be a pain in the ass to achieve with vanilla html, css, js. So, there's that 😅

### 🔮 Future plans
🛠 🛠 🛠 More overengineering 🛠 🛠 🛠

* Replacing setState() with MobX
* Fetching data from an API
* Server side rendering, etc. etc.
